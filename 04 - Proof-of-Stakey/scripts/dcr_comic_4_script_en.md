## Proof of Stakey



01

Title: Proof-of-Stake(y)

Decred mixes Proof-of-Stake voting and Proof-of-Work mining. This combination tightens the security and gives holders the tools to lead.



02

DCR holders can buy tickets with their coins and use them to decide how Decred operates.



03

Each new block picks five tickets to vote at random and requires signed votes from at least 3 tickets to be valid.



04

After voting, ticket owners get their DCR refunded and earn a share (6%) of the block reward.



05

Stakeholders can influence PoW miners by voting to reject their blocks if certain conditions are met.



06

Vote for or against changes to the consensus rules.

07

Decide on treasury expenditure proposals through Politeia.



08

Decision makers are the users who hold the coin. Proof-of-Stake voting puts the Decred community in charge and sets the foundations for building a decentralized organization.
