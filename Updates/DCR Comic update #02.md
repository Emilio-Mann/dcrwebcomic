# DCR Comic update #01

This is our second update, the first one since the proposal passed. We have exciting news to share. If are on a rush, there's a TLDR at the bottom.

## Project health

It took us some time to get back on track with the comics, but we are proud about the fourth one, Proof-of-Stakey, and excited about the coming issue on privacy that features ninjas and the mystic ticket stream. With our productivity is back to normal levels, curiosity is picking up the pace. We are trying out new stuff. Will share as soon as possible (keep reading to know more).

## Comics

1, 2 and 3 got revamped while we worked and discussed the proposal. They've also been translated to Spanish, Chinese, French, Arabic and Russian. We would love to have Portuguese, Japanese and Korean translations.

4 was published a few weeks ago. Proof-of-Stakey explains how Decred's PoS component works and the how stakeholders can participate in the decision making process. Proof-of-Stakey is now  up for translations (translators: get in touch or just send a PR on GitHub. PS: we love you all).

All four comics can also be found in square format (for platforms such as Instagram) in the GitHub repo, under the images folder inside each comic.

5th comic about Privacy was published a just now!

## Assets

We've started separating and classifying graphic assets. It began as a means to make social media posting easier, but we are trying to keep it public and organized so that other community members can use them. Maybe Telegram stickers.

## New site!

We are putting up a site for DCR Comic because we felt it needed a home, and some pointed out that having everything in one site would be quite handy. It's a simple Pelican/Jinja2 static site. It is already up and running at [dcrcomic.org](https://dcrcomic.org/)

## Physical comics at LABITCONF

We made a bunch of physical copies of the first five DCR Comics to share them at LABITCONF, the Latin American Bitcoin and Blockchain Conference that takes place at Montevideo, Uruguay. We'll try to get the comics to Antonopoulos and other key bitcoin figures.

## Current explorations

**Animation:** Many community members pointed out they would prefer having animated explainer videos. While the focus is on the comics (meaning the topics, the tone, the characters and the grand scheme), we are already exploring animation. The first DCR Comic animated video is on the works. We've chosen the 5th comic, because ninjas. We'll share some sneak peaks as soon as we have something.

**3D:** Nachito is diving into 3D models. We may have a 3D Stakey model soon. This opens up the door for other kind of projects. Possibilities are huge, but so is the workload. We need to get creative to get as much as possible out of 3D or it won't be cost-effective.

**Interactive tutorial:** After setting up the first version of dcrcomic.org, Pablito is exploring simple web app development to use DCR Comic assets to build and interactive Decred tutorial. Scope will be limited to: reading a simple intro, learning about Decrediton and setting up a wallet.

## TLDR

We are happy. Four comics already published and translated. The fifth has ninjas. There are lots of cool pngs at GitHub you can use to post on social media. THE COMIC HAS A NEW WEBSITE. We have printed physical comics for LABITCONF. We are doing some animation, some 3D and figuring out how to develop an interactive Decred tutorial web app.
