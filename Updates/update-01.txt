Webcomic Update #01

After reading the feedback we got from the people in Matrix, we developed a short-term roadmap and decided on some guidelines for future issues.

Characters: we will move forward with the “Ticket Universe” approach, meaning that every character will be a Ticket like Stakey, but they won’t be referred to as Stakey.
Accuracy: we will try to make the narrator as accurate as possible with the help of the community. This may make it less newbie friendly, but we are assuming most readers at this stage will have some basic understanding of cryptocurrencies. We will talk to the broader altcoin community. Visuals will remain 
Workflow: we put together a Webcomic Lifecycle that makes translating and editing the comic more efficient by focusing first on closing the English version and only opening up for translations once it is finished.
Voting for episodes: we are trying to decentralize the roadmap by enabling anyone to vote on what topics should be covered next. As for the next ones, we have taken into account feedback the community gave us through Matrix and Github.

The English and Spanish versions of the first webcomic are ready! You can get the jpeg export here or export your own using the AI files.

We are now brainstorming three more episodes. Many asked for one about the hybrid PoS/PoW system. To explain it in full detail we will develop a three part webcomic. The first one will explain how Proof-of-Work works, the second one will dive into the advantages of Proof-of-Stake, and the last one will put everything together to wrap the series with Decred’s hybrid approach.
