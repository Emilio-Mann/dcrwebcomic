# DCR Comic #05: Privacy matters



**01**

In a world where anyone could be tracking your behavior...

Privacy matters.



**02**

There are several privacy implementations in the wild. But many open the door to new problems that affect core principles like decentralization and transparency.



**03**

Since 2017, Decred has been developing simple and secure solutions. The first one is now live.



**04**

A new mixnet allows holders to mix their funds and make anonymous transactions.



**05**

It is powered by a phenomenon unique to Decred: the steady DCR stream that flows into tickets.



**06**

More than 50% of the total DCR is staked. The mixnet operates by epochs and users gather to mix their coins with the ticket stream. No one stands out in this big crowd.



**07**

This new service is just another step forward. Decred will keep improving/iterating on its privacy so every user can benefit.
