# DCR Comic #05: Privacy matters

**01**

In a world where anyone could be **tracking your behavior**...

**Privacy matters.**

**02**

There are other **privacy** **implementations** in the wild. But some deter security and others add too much complexity.

**03**

Since 2017, Decred has been developing **simple** and **secure** solutions. **The first one is now live.**

**04**

A new **mixnet** allows holders to mix their funds and make **anonymous** **transactions**.

**05**

It is powered by a phenomenon unique to Decred: the **non**-**stopping** stream of **DCR** that flows into Proof-of-Stake voting tickets.

**06**

At any point in time, there are many **equal** **size** transactions. The mixnet operates by  **epochs** and users gather to mix their coins with the ticket stream.

**07**

The mixnet is another step forward. Decred will keep **improving**/**iterating** its privacy. **Mastering** old techniques and **inventing** new ones along the way.
