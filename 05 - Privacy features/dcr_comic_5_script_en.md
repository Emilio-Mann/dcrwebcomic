# DCR Comic #05: Privacy matters

**01**

In a world where anyone could be **tracking your behavior**...

**Privacy matters.**



**02**A

There are other **privacy implementations** in the wild. But some open up **new problems** that affect **decentralization** and **transparency**.

**02**B

There are other **privacy implementations** in the wild. But most could be **improved**.

**02**C

There are other **privacy** **implementations** in the wild. Some could be **improved** and others bring up **new** **problems**.

**02**D

There are other **privacy** **implementations** in the wild. But "pretty good privacy" remains distant.



**03**A

Since 2017, Decred has been developing **simple** and **secure** solutions. **The first one is now live.**

**03**B

Since 2017, Decred has been developing **new** solutions. **The first one is now live.**



**04**

A new **mixnet** allows holders to mix their funds and make **anonymous** **transactions**.

**05**

It is powered by a phenomenon unique to Decred: the steady **DCR** **stream** that flows into **tickets**.

**06**

The mixnet operates by  **epochs** and users gather to mix their coins with the ticket stream. Having more than 50% of (total) DCR staked, no  one stands out in this **big** **crowd**.

**07**

The mixnet is another step forward. Decred will keep **improving**/**iterating** its privacy. **Mastering** old techniques and **inventing** new ones along the way.
