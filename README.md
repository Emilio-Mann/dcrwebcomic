# DCR Comic

A visual guide to [Decred](https://decred.org), the autonomous digital currency.

**DCR Comic** explains the **technology, rules and platforms** that make **Decred's network** and **DAO**.



## The proposal

We have currently submitted a proposal to fund the development of the comic. You can read the proposal at [Politeia](https://proposals.decred.org) or [this repo](https://github.com/pLabarta/dcrwebcomic/blob/master/Proposal/DCR%20Comic:%20a%20visual%20guide%20to%20Decred.md) and, if you are a Decred ticket holder, decide on it when voting begins.
