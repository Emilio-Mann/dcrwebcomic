## 04

**Narrator:** "But without exchanges, users face a big problem: Who sends the money first? Between unconnected blockchains, there is no way to ensure honesty."

## 05

**Narrator:** "The Decred DEX will use Atomic Swaps so both parties have full control of their assets. Both transactions happen at the same time."

## 06

**Narrator:** "Anyone will be able to set up a DEX node. More nodes means a stronger DEX network!"

**Setting:** A ticket has mounted a little DEX node stand. It should not be super fancy nor super cheap.

**Setting:** A bunch of tickets lining up to register.



## 08

**Narrator:** A DEX does not have a singler server. It is distributed across the globe, run by users like you. These are exchanges made by the users for the users.

**Setting:** "The Earth as seen from the space. There are lots of little DEX nodes. There is one in the moon. There are astronauts and rockets. One is a lovely shiba. The other one is a ticket."
