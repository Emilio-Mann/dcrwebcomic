The Way of the Contractor
by Crypto Rocket Solutions
& the Decred Community

02
Stakey has a great idea to push Decred's growth.

03
To bring it to life, he goes to Politeia, the community forum.

04
Other members comment and suggest changes to the proposal.
Then, Stakey modifies it and starts the voting phase.

05
The Voting Phase lasts 2016 blocks, close to a week.
20% of the existing tickets MUST PARTICIPATE
60% of those tickets MUST VOTE 'YES'

06
Once the proposal is approved, Stakey can get to work!

07
As Stakey delivers the results, the community pays him!
Now, he can continue to collaborate with Decred's (r)evolution.
